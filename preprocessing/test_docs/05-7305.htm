ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

40 CFR Part 52

[TX-80-1-7353; FRL--7897-7]


Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Texas; 15% 
Rate-of-Progress Plan and Motor Vehicle Emissions Budgets, Dallas/Fort 
Worth Ozone Nonattainment Area

AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision 
for the State of Texas for the 15% Rate-of-Progress Plan (ROP) and 15% 
ROP Motor Vehicle Emissions Budget (MVEB) for the Dallas/Fort Worth 
(DFW) ozone nonattainment area. This plan shows planned emission 
reductions required by the Clean Air Act (Act) from 1990 to 1996 to 
improve air quality in the Dallas/Fort Worth Area. The reductions are 
from the 1990 base year emissions inventory. The MVEBs are used for 
determining conformity of transportation projects to the SIP. This 
action satisfies the Act's requirements for an ozone nonattainment 
area's 15% Rate-of-Progress Plan and approves the MVEBs under the ROP 
Plan.

DATES: This rule is effective on May 12, 2005.

ADDRESSES: Copies of the documents relevant to this action are in the 
official file which is available at the Air Planning Section (6PD-L), 
Environmental Protection Agency, 1445 Ross Avenue, Suite 700, Dallas, 
Texas 75202-2733. The file will be made available by appointment for

1. What Action Is EPA Taking?

    EPA is taking full approval action on the 15% ROP plan for the DFW 
ozone nonattainment area, submitted by Texas on August 8, 1996, since 
we have now finalized approval of the State's motor vehicle Inspection/
Maintenance (I/M) program for the DFW area. We are also taking final 
action on the Motor Vehicle Emissions Budget (MVEB) contained in the 
15% ROP Plan.

II. What Is the Background for This Action?

    We proposed full approval of the 15% ROP plan on January 28, 2001. 
The Plan was submitted on August 8, 1996. The Plan was given 
conditional, interim approval on November 10, 1998, pending corrections 
to the DFW I/M program (63 FR 62943). It was given conditional, interim 
approval because it relied on emissions reductions from the I/M program 
that received conditional, interim approval.
    For further information on the I/M conditional, interim approval, 
see 62 FR 37138, published on July 11, 1997. We found later that the 
State met the conditions of the conditional approval. We removed the 
conditions and granted Texas a final interim approval of the I/M 
program on April 23, 1999. See, 64 FR 19910.
    Texas then submitted significant revisions to the I/M program for 
the DFW area. The revisions expanded the program from the 2 core 
nonattainment counties to the 4 counties in the nonattainment area plus 
5 additional counties and upgraded the stringency of the program. As a 
result of these improvements in the I/M program, we took final approval 
action on the I/M program on November 14, 2001, (66 FR 57261).
    We indicated in the proposed full approval of the DFW 15% plan that 
the plan would not be finalized until final action on the I/M program 
was complete. Therefore, because we have completed final action on the 
I/M program, we can now take final action on the 15% ROP Plan and the 
associated MVEB.
    The MVEB in the plan is for Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). The 
VOC budget is 165.49 tons per day for 1996. There is no requirement for 
a Nitrogen Oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) budget in the 15% plans.
    We have received no new information that would change the 
approvability of the ROP target calculations and none of the credits 
relied upon for meeting the ROP targets have changed since our proposal 
date. Therefore, this plan meets the Reasonable Further Progress 
requirements of the Act (section 182(b)(1)).
    Please refer to 66 FR 4764, January 18, 2001, and its technical 
support document (TSD) for additional details on the 15% Plan, as well 
as the TSD for the November 1998 proposal action.

III. What Comments Were Received During the Public Comment Period, 
January 18, 2001, to March 19, 2001?

    We did not receive any comments on the 15% ROP Plan or the 
associated MVEB.

IV. Final Action

    EPA is approving the 15% Rate of Progress plan and the Motor 
Vehicle Emissions Budgets submitted by Texas on August 8, 1996, for the 
DFW ozone nonattainment area. The VOC MVEB for the ROP plan is 165.49 
tons per day for 1996.

V. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews

    Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), this 
action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' and therefore is not 
subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. For this 
reason, this action is also not subject to Executive Order 13211, 
``Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy 
Supply, Distribution, or Use'' (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001). This action 
merely approves state law as meeting Federal requirements and imposes 
no additional requirements beyond those imposed by state law. 
Accordingly, the Administrator certifies that this rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities 
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). Because 
this rule approves pre-existing requirements under state law and does 
not impose any additional enforceable duty beyond that required by 
state law, it does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or 
uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4).
    This rule also does not have tribal implications because it will 
not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on 
the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or 
on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal 
Government and Indian tribes, as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 
FR 67249, November 9, 2000). This action also does not have federalism 
implications because it does not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the National Government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the 
various levels of government, as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 
FR 43255, August 10, 1999). This action merely approves a state rule 
implementing a Federal standard, and does not alter the relationship or 
the distribution of power and responsibilities established in the Clean 
Air Act. This rule also is not subject to Executive Order 13045 
``Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety 
Risks'' (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997), because it is not economically 
significant.
    In reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve state 
choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the Clean Air Act. In 
this context, in the absence of a prior existing requirement for the 
State to use voluntary consensus standards (VCS), EPA has no authority 
to disapprove a SIP submission for failure to use VCS. It would thus be 
inconsistent with applicable law for EPA, when it reviews a SIP 
submission, to use VCS in place of a SIP submission that otherwise 
satisfies the provisions of the Clean Air Act. Thus, the requirements 
of section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement 
Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) do not apply. This rule does not 
impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).
    The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. section 801 et seq., as 
added by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 
1996, generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency 
promulgating the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy 
of the rule, to each House of the Congress

[[Page 18995]]

and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a 
report containing this rule and other required information to the U.S. 
Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General 
of the United States prior to publication of the rule in the Federal 
Register. A major rule cannot take effect until 60 days after it is 
published in the Federal Register. This action is not a ``major rule'' 
as defined by 5 U.S.C. section 804(2).
    Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for 
judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court 
of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 13, 2005. Filing a 
petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule 
does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial 
review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial 
review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such 
rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings 
to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
